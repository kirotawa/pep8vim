##Dependency:
	- pep8 tool/command

##Install:
	- copy .vim and .py file to your ./vim/plugin

##How to use:
	- [ESC]: PEP8

## Questions?
  	- Why not just type :!pep8 filename.py ?
	A: yes, you can do it, but it's just a workaround for now.
	My plans are to modify and do other things than that. :)
